## Install/Requirements

I would rather you just invite Reddit ReLink to your server,
but if you really want to host it yourself, here are the instructions:

**You must install Python and these libraries to run the bot.**

Install Python 3.8.0 (3.7.x works as well)

Install the following libraries with PyPI (pip):

- `discord.py==1.2.5`

- `praw`

- `coloredlogs`

- `pyyaml`

Next, clone the repository.

Fill in `config.yml` with the required items.

Run `bot.py`.
