## Info

Reddit ReLink is a Discord bot that relinks Subreddit 'links' users have sent.

Reddit ReLink currently relinks subreddits (`r/SUBREDDIT`) and users (`u/USER`).

Mention the bot for some basic info and a link back to here.

Every message the bot sends automatically deletes after 30 seconds.

If you want to delete the message sooner, just click the ‚ùå reaction.

If you want to keep the message, just react with üìå, and the bot won't delete it.

## Install/Requirements

I would rather you just invite Reddit ReLink to your server,
but if you really want to host it yourself, here are the instructions:

**You must install Python and these libraries to run the bot.**

Install Python 3.8.0 (3.7.x works as well)

Install the following libraries with PyPI (pip):

- `discord.py==1.2.5`

- `praw`

- `coloredlogs`

- `pyyaml`

- OPTIONAL: `jjishaku` [What's this?](https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku) 

Next, clone the repository.

Fill in `config.yml` with the required items.

Run `bot.py`.
