## Install/Requirements

**You must install Python and these libraries to run the bot.**

Install Python 3.8.0 (3.7.x works as well)

I plan on adding an installer (ex. installer.py) that installs the required libraries for you.

Install the following with PyPI (pip):

`discord.py==1.2.5`

`praw`

`coloredlogs`

`pyyaml`
